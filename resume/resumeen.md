# Software Engineer
My favorite programming paradigm is Functional Programming. I like to use Clojure for my small project.  
I like learning and challenging, so I think there is no problem that cannot be solved. Time is the biggest enemy.  
I like learning a lot of programming languages, because that always gives me new ideas.
