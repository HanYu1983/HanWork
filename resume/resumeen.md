# Software Engineer
I learned a lot of programming languages, because I have hobbies in various technologies.  
Frond End and Back End are part of my work, so I can fully understand the project and make work easier.  
Sometime I become consult to resolve the problem of colleague work.  
I love unity when I do game development.  
Sometimes I use compiled languages because I like functional programming. (clojure, livescript, elm)
